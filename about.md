## About Hack ID
In late-ish 2016, I started thinking about my own instructional design education and how it's mostly been the function of reading whatever resources I could get my hands on (okay: I got to go to one ID certificate class from ATD [really good!] but I *still* haven't been to a conference). Those resources have been invaluable to my growth as a designer and to my career progression.

Inspired by HackDesign.org, Free Code Camp, and Designers for Learning (all listed on this site), I started thinking about what a free education specifically for instructional designers might look like. I thought about the more passive email course route, about a possible curriculum of interactive challenges with portfolio reviews. I thought about a network of in-person meetups. I thought about a series of (or one massive) instructional design open-source projects that would let newbie IDs get experience. And I still think any one of those would be a super-awesome idea... but I can't pull those off alone. Those would take a village of IDs collaborating to bring them to life.

So, in the spirit of starting small, I figured a great first step would be a site that let other newbie IDs discover the free resources that have brought myself and others this far. That's what Hack ID is for.

I don't store user data and the links of the resources are redirected to the sites of the authors or content hosts.
