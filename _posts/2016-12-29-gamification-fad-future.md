{% include JB/setup %}

In this latest offering from HT2 you'll be able to inform your own practice by taking a look at 'Gamification' and answering these questions.

- What is it?
- Who's using it?
- What benefits does it bring?
- How could you use it?

As well as some 'behind the scenes' peeks at how Curatr uses Gamification and how you can get access to Curatr to experiment with Gamification for yourself.
