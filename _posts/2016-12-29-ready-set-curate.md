Let's face it, the internet isn't getting any smaller. How do we separate the valuable content from the noise, how do we organise the good stuff in ways that tell coherent stories about our businesses and our interests? In this latest offering from HT2 you'll be able to inform your own practice by taking a look at 'Curation' and answering these questions.

- What are the 'pros' & 'cons'?
- What do I need to think about before I get started?
- What tools are available for me to use?
