Regardless of your job title, if you're working within the field of E-Learning, particularly within a production capacity, you need an e-learning portfolio.

An e-learning portfolio will promote you as a developer, acting as a visual resume for your peer, colleagues, or prospective clients. This is especially important if youâ€™re seeking a new profession or looking to add independent contracting or freelance development to your resume.
