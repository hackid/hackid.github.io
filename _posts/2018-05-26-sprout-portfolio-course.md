Regardless of your job title, if you're working within the field of E-Learning, particularly within a production capacity, you need an e-learning portfolio.

An e-learning portfolio will promote you as a developer, acting as a visual resume for your peer, colleagues, or prospective clients. This is especially important if you’re seeking a new profession or looking to add independent contracting or freelance development to your resume.

By the end of this course, you should be able to:

- Identify the importance of an e-learning portfolio
- Recognize common challenges related to building an e-learning portfolio, and how to overcome these challenges
- Identify methods for building out and/or hosting your portfolio
- Outline methods for promoting your portfolio

Building an e-learning portfolio doesn’t need to be an overwhelming task, and my goal is to walk you through the process of creating and sharing one e-learning sample that you can include in your portfolio. Don’t worry - We’ll do this together!
