The first day of a new job.

Itâ€™s a pivotal moment for both new employee and employer, but without the right induction or onboarding this new working relationship could be short-lived.

Businesses with effective induction training have a 50% higher retention rate of new staff, as well as improved employee engagement and productivity.

Find out how elearning can help your organisation deliver a high quality, consistent induction experience with our complimentary handbook, A rough guide to induction.
