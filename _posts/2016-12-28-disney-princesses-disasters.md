One of the more robust Internet trends has been reimagining the well-loved Disney Princesses in different situations. From the imaginative Disney Princesses Reimagined as “Real Life” Women to the provocative Disney Princesses Reimagined as Different Races to the absurd Disney Princesses Reimagined as Hot Dogs, these iconic characters seem to be useful in revealing aspects of our world that might otherwise go unrecognized.

In this spirit, Ethan Edwards puts this lens to the design of e-learning to shed new light on some problems and risks that we face and have become blind to by illustrating 12 Disney Princesses Reimagined as e-Learning Disasters.
