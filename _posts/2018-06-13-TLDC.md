The Training, Learning, and Development Community’s focus is on Everyday Improvement for all of our Members and Subscribers. And one of the best tools for maximizing your Professional Development is Conferences.

TLDCHAT is an “every weekday” hour-long, online, video/audio/text broadcast focused on Training, Learning, and Development.  It’s not a webinar – it’s a mix between a conference session and a hallway conversation — because we all know that’s where the true value of a conference resides.
