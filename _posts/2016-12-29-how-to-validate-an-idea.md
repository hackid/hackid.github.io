Have you ever had a good idea but weren’t sure what to do next? Do you file for a business license? Build a website? Quit your job?

This course demystifies the idea validation process without fancy jargon like “lean startup” or expensive software. Learn from a three-time founder how to think deeply about the problem you’re solving, as well as learn tactics to freely distribute your ideas to potential customers.
