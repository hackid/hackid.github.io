This course focuses on the technical side of xAPI: getting up-and-running with a Learning Record Store.

You won’t need to be a programmer to take part, but you will need some experience of implementing servers, software and systems administration in general.

You’ll also need access to a server (either on cloud, like AWS, or on your own devices) and administration rights to install new software.
