When people talk about customary approaches to eLearning, they usually envision self-paced courses, tutorials, and synchronous virtual classroom training. Still popular after 20 years, this “traditional” type of eLearning is typically designed and structured as a formal solution. It originated in one-way communication (web 1.0), much like email originated from traditional mail. Done right, for the right reasons, it works.

Mobile learning, on the other hand, originated in two-way communication (web 2.0), defies the customary approach to eLearning, and shifts the control and responsibility for learning. From a design perspective, mobile forces us to rethink our approach to learning. It forces us to see learners as mobile. Done right, it also works.

A collection of essays curated by Janet Clarey, Mobile Learning in Context explores topics from implementation to how to motivate learners to complete training. Written by an international group of mobile innovators, their writings might inspire you rethink where mobile learning fits in your existing learning ecosystem.
