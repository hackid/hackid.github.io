We are stoked to announce the launch of our free ebook Unity Programming for Human Beings, authored by software engineer and game developer Jesse Glove, in collaboration with Pablo Farias Navarro, founder of Zenva.

In over 230 pages of awesomeness, the book starts from zero and covers all the way to building simple 2D and 3D games with Unity.
