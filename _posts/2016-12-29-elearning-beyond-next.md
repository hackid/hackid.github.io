In this latest free offering from HT2 we've taking something of a brave (some might say foolish, but we prefer 'experimental') approach to our design.

We're intending to facilitate a year-long conversation that will focus initially on the term 'elearning' and considering what that means in 2016, before using each month of the year to a look at a current or emerging technology that could be used to enhance the practice of those of you in a people development role. These monthly topics will become available on the 1st of each month.
