Learn how context has usurped content as the new king in the enterprise, and why this shift should be your learning and development team’s number-one priority.

Content is the foundation of your learning programs, but it is no longer the whole story. Putting your content into context—providing employees with instant and easy access to the content that is relevant to them—is the new standard for learning and development.

With numerous studies pointing to a majority of companies pouring their focus (and money) into generating more and more content, prioritizing context has never been more necessary. This eBook explains why context matters in the modern mobile enterprise, and how you can build it into your learning programs successfully.
