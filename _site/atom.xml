&lt;p&gt;Today’s interaction designers generally operate within well-researched and documented constraints for both web and mobile applications—but not for much longer. By mixing the real and virtual worlds, new products such as Hololens, DAQRI, Meta, and Magic Leap clearly demonstrate that designers no longer have to confine user interfaces to a screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this O’Reilly report, author Kharis O’Connell guides you through the new realm of mixed reality. You’ll discover the difference between designing for arenas rather than web or mobile screen rectangles, and examine some of the supporting tools, technologies, and techniques that will enable you to make the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Devices Everywhere: Designing for a Multi-Device World</title>

   <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;People today use multiple connected devices—PCs, smartphones, tablets, TVs, and beyond—switching between them, and using them together in order to accomplish a single goal. Still, most products merely replicate the same experience across devices, substituting solos for what could be an orchestra. In this session, I’d like to introduce ‘The 3C’s”- an ecosystem approach for designing multi-device experiences, one that focuses on context.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;Today’s learners use multiple computing/communication devices during the course of the day - for learning, work, entertainment, and decision making. They are on the move, both within and outside the workplace, and want to use their “downtime” effectively. Responsive eLearning helps organizations to leverage this “downtime” while extending the reach and availability of their training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like any other approach, Responsive eLearning comes with its own set of planning, design, development and testing considerations and guidelines - and it forces those of us who create responsive eLearning to think beyond just one fixed display size and one uniform use context. Hence, understanding the key features, benefits, types, examples of Responsive eLearning is important in drawing up a strategy that works for your organization. With respect to the strategy, decision factors like when to use responsive eLearning, how to get started and the various challenges you may encounter in the design, development and testing process are crucial to the success of your strategy. Learn about it all in this eBook.&lt;/p&gt;
