<p>Today’s learners use multiple computing/communication devices during the course of the day - for learning, work, entertainment, and decision making. They are on the move, both within and outside the workplace, and want to use their “downtime” effectively. Responsive eLearning helps organizations to leverage this “downtime” while extending the reach and availability of their training.</p>

<p>Like any other approach, Responsive eLearning comes with its own set of planning, design, development and testing considerations and guidelines - and it forces those of us who create responsive eLearning to think beyond just one fixed display size and one uniform use context. Hence, understanding the key features, benefits, types, examples of Responsive eLearning is important in drawing up a strategy that works for your organization. With respect to the strategy, decision factors like when to use responsive eLearning, how to get started and the various challenges you may encounter in the design, development and testing process are crucial to the success of your strategy. Learn about it all in this eBook.</p>

<p>Presentations are planned conversations and prescheduled leadership opportunities where you have a chance to shine as a leader - and influence conversations. Take a short survey and receive a deeper profile of your Presenter Type. By understanding your Presenter Type, you will be better able to reframe your audience’s thinking and incite them to action.</p>

<p>When people talk about customary approaches to eLearning, they usually envision self-paced courses, tutorials, and synchronous virtual classroom training. Still popular after 20 years, this “traditional” type of eLearning is typically designed and structured as a formal solution. It originated in one-way communication (web 1.0), much like email originated from traditional mail. Done right, for the right reasons, it works.</p>

<p>Mobile learning, on the other hand, originated in two-way communication (web 2.0), defies the customary approach to eLearning, and shifts the control and responsibility for learning. From a design perspective, mobile forces us to rethink our approach to learning. It forces us to see learners as mobile. Done right, it also works.</p>

<p>A collection of essays curated by Janet Clarey, Mobile Learning in Context explores topics from implementation to how to motivate learners to complete training. Written by an international group of mobile innovators, their writings might inspire you rethink where mobile learning fits in your existing learning ecosystem.</p>

<p>This recently published book “Level 0” is a resource designed for the absolute beginner. You’ll learn how to set up characters and backgrounds, apply in-game mechanics and implement if – then functions and end up with five fully functional mini-games. The book will also show you how to publish your games to app stores and make them available to millions of potential customers around the world.</p>

<p>The goal of Level 0 is to give aspiring game developers the basic building blocks to apply their creativity and bring their vision to life. For example, one of the mini-games you’ll learn to build is a simple sound board app where you click on an image and the corresponding sound will play. Through this exercise, not only do you pick up the skills to build a virtual keyboard or maybe an educational app that teaches kids the sounds farm animals make but also learn how to use sound, music and touch functions that can be used for subsequent arcade and action games.</p>

<p>Each of the 5 mini-games covered in the book has already been used by thousands of Construct 2 users to build their first game on Construct 2.</p>

<p>What if you launch a business…and nobody buys?</p>

<p>What if you could skip ALL of the guesswork?</p>

<p>You’d never have to wonder, “is this a good idea?” or “are people going to want it enough to pay for it?” Don’t you wish you could peek inside your customers’ brains? It would let you make sure that you’re working on something they’ll actually buy. So much pain and heartache could be avoided.</p>

<p>This is where we come in &amp; show you how to create something YOU KNOW your customers REALLY want.</p>

<p>Social has been one of the watch words in L&amp;D trends in recent years. Some experts suggest that all learning is social, some say you can design social learning experience - others say you can’t touch it and that L&amp;D professionals should just stand back and let it happen.</p>

<p>But do we even have a common understanding of what it is?</p>

<p>In this latest offering from HT2 you’ll be able to inform your own practice by taking a look at ‘Social Learning’ by exploring:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The changing world and workplace.</li>
  <li>Various social learning theories.</li>
  <li>The relationship between social, formal and informal learning.</li>
  <li>Various strategies, tools, methods and approaches.</li>

<p>You’ve heard the old adage, “Don’t judge a book by its cover.” While the most tattered, sorry-looking book can hold delightful, exciting stories inside, we often overlook it in favor of a gorgeously designed hardcover. The same is true about e-learning. Even if your content is Pulitzer-worthy, your learners will find it difficult to be engaged if your course doesn’t appeal to their visual senses.</p>

<p>The good news is that you don’t have to be a visual designer to build beautiful courses. There are five simple ingredients to good visual design: color, contrast, repetition, alignment, and balance. In this e-book, we’ll look at each of these key ingredients and show you how to use them.</p>

<p>In this latest free offering from HT2 we’ve taking something of a brave (some might say foolish, but we prefer ‘experimental’) approach to our design.</p>

<p>We’re intending to facilitate a year-long conversation that will focus initially on the term ‘elearning’ and considering what that means in 2016, before using each month of the year to a look at a current or emerging technology that could be used to enhance the practice of those of you in a people development role. These monthly topics will become available on the 1st of each month.</p>

<p>We know not everyone can make a trip to the d.school to experience how we teach design thinking. So, we created this online version of one of our most frequently sought after learning tools. Using the video, handouts, and facilitation tips below, we will take you step by step through the process of hosting or participating in a 90 minute design challenge.</p>

<p>If you choose to participate, in 90 minutes you will be taken through a full design cycle by participating in The Gift-Giving Project. This is a fast-paced project where participants pair up to interview each other, identify real needs, and develop a solution to “redesign the gift-giving experience” for their partner. NO PREVIOUS DESIGN EXPERIENCE REQUIRED. We’ll provide all the information you need to be successful, whether you are just pairing up with one other person or you are gathering a large group  (great for organizations, schools, or companies).</p>

<p>Through this experience we hope you will take away some of the basic principles of Design Thinking and start to adapt them into your personal and professional routines.</p>

<p>Learn how context has usurped content as the new king in the enterprise, and why this shift should be your learning and development team’s number-one priority.</p>

<p>Content is the foundation of your learning programs, but it is no longer the whole story. Putting your content into context—providing employees with instant and easy access to the content that is relevant to them—is the new standard for learning and development.</p>

<p>With numerous studies pointing to a majority of companies pouring their focus (and money) into generating more and more content, prioritizing context has never been more necessary. This eBook explains why context matters in the modern mobile enterprise, and how you can build it into your learning programs successfully.</p>

<p>Atomic design provides a clear methodology for crafting design systems. Clients and team members are able to better appreciate the concept of design systems by actually seeing the steps laid out in front of them.</p>

<p>Atomic design gives us the ability to traverse from abstract to concrete. Because of this, we can create systems that promote consistency and scalability while simultaneously showing things in their final context. And by assembling rather than deconstructing, we’re crafting a system right out of the gate instead of cherry picking patterns after the fact.</p>

<p>Tis the season of holiday sweaters—each lovingly created with good intent, sometimes gaudy, sometimes uncomfortable, sometimes utilitarian, but rarely as beautiful as imagined. The same can often be said about e-learning course designs.</p>

<p>We start out with the intention to create something uniquely satisfying for our learners, but after accounting for strained resources, limited time, imperfect development tools, complex subject matter, and unpredictable learners, we end up with something not quite as beautiful as we’d hoped.</p>

<p>In an individualized learning setting, like asynchronous web-based training programs, active learner engagement is necessary for learning to occur.So while it is important for the instructional designer to get the content “right,” it is even more vital (and usually more challenging) to design interactivity to draw in the learner to commit to the authentic behavior needed for learning to occur.</p>

<p>This e-book presents six straightforward and effective design strategies to create learner motivation in e-learning.</p>

<p>Instructional designers of e-learning face a constant challenge of how to create learning experiences that actually make a difference. Too many of the accepted and easy approaches result in e-learning courses that fail to motivate, engage, or empower learners. Sophisticated simulations and technically-sophisticated designs seem out of reach for many instructional designers.</p>

<p>In this e-book, learn:</p>

<ul>
  <li>10 practical principles that should be implemented at any level of complexity to create training experiences that are transforming and memorable.</li>
  <li>Actionable tips to implement these principles into your e-learning designs.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Context, Challenge, Activity, and Feedback (CCAF) Instructional Design Model is a powerful tool to guide the design of engaging and effective online interactions.</p>

<p>Instructional designers appreciate the power of these elements and are impressed when presented with finished interactions that exemplify these principles. However, when faced with designing an interaction from scratch, many designers find it difficult to break out of the traditional tedious multiple choice and true/false formats that are used so often.</p>

<p>This e-book provides seven small steps to improved interactions while recognizing that capabilities with authoring software might be quite limited. If you begin applying these steps while you are designing questions, you will quickly open up a world of much more powerful design possibilities.</p>

<p>One of the more robust Internet trends has been reimagining the well-loved Disney Princesses in different situations. From the imaginative Disney Princesses Reimagined as “Real Life” Women to the provocative Disney Princesses Reimagined as Different Races to the absurd Disney Princesses Reimagined as Hot Dogs, these iconic characters seem to be useful in revealing aspects of our world that might otherwise go unrecognized.</p>

<p>In this spirit, Ethan Edwards puts this lens to the design of e-learning to shed new light on some problems and risks that we face and have become blind to by illustrating 12 Disney Princesses Reimagined as e-Learning Disasters.</p>
